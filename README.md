# Plater Flow support app

This application takes STL files from a directory and plates them using Plater.
It can then slice them with SuperSlicer and upload them to your printer using Moonraker API.

The goal is to provide a quick way of getting a bunch of STL's printable with your common settings.
No hassle doing this all manually.

## Limitations
